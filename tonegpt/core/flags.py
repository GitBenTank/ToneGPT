Feature flags for ToneGPT system

TL;DR: Feature flags for future expansion while maintaining FM9 single-mode focus.
- FEATURE_MULTI_DEVICE: Reserved for future multi-device support (adapters only)
- All flags default to False to maintain current single-mode architecture
- No advanced mode flags (single-mode only per Cursor Rules)
- Feature flags only used in adapters, never in core modules

Constraints:
- FM9 single-mode only (docs/ground-truth.md#Invariants)
- Feature flags in adapters only (docs/ground-truth.md#Future-proofing)
- No advanced mode logic (docs/ground-truth.md#Invariants)
